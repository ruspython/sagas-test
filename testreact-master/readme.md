# Questionnare

## For this assignment you will create questionnaire app using the following technologies:

- ReactJS
- Redux/Saga
- Webpack
- ES6 / ES2015
- https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate
- WebStorm (preferred, not required)

### Functionality
- The user starts with an empty questionnare list.
- The user can add a new questionnare.
- A questionnaire contains a list of questions.
- A question is linked to a section.
- Questions are grouped (display only) per main section.
- The questionnaire overview is openened.
- The overview contains a card for each section.
- The card displays the section name and question stats for that section.
- When the user clicks a card, the section view is opened.
- Per sub-section, all questions are displayed.
- The user can navigate back and forward through sub sections.
- Live statistics and a progress bar are displayed live for the section.
- When the user is done filling in the last section, the user can finish the section and is brought back to the questionnare overview.
- The user can then proceed to the next section.
- There should be navigation (routing, browserHistory).
- The application should be internationalized (English and any other language of choice). Internationalize 3 fields to save time.
- There should be a dev and a prod build. What tools / libraries / support will you add to the dev build?
- Create your own implementation of a simple questionnare, simmilar to the provided test questionnaire.
- Simulate getting and saving data using a mock service.

### Not required!
- It's not required to create / define Questions and Sections.
- There is no need to store the data server side / persistant.
- Implementing the remarks is not needed.

### Testing
- Please create tests for all parts of the application (actions, components, reducers, store, etc.).
- You don't have to create tests for everyting, but try to create at least 1 test for each unique part.

### Design
- The time on this assignment should be spent on functionality **not design**!

### Final words
- This assignment is for you to show you know your way around the React.js / Redux stack and all frameworks, libraries, and other components that are related to it (webpack, babel, ES6, async, testing, etc.). You must show that you can implement maintainable and well structured code that is also suitable to extend to large projects (hundrets of components, models, etc.).

### Submission
- The completed project should be pushed to github
- Submit the github url via upwork messaging when you have completed the project
